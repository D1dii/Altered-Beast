Description:

Altered Beast is a classic arcade-style action game developed by Sega in 1988. 
The game was designed for the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive console and later released 
on other platforms like the NES, Wii or Xbox360.

The game takes place in ancient Greece, and the player controls a warrior who is 
brought back to life by Zeus to rescue Athena, who has been kidnapped by the demon 
god Neff. The game has five levels, and the player character gains the ability to 
transform into various "Altered Beasts" (hence the name of the game) by collecting 
power-ups.
